# XeonVPN

An advanced VPN project written in Rust, optimized for Asia regions (SG, JP, ID, HK, IN). XeonVPN aims for high performance, privacy, and strong anti-censorship/obfuscation capabilities across desktop and mobile platforms.

This repository currently contains a Proof-of-Concept (POC) QUIC transport with a minimal server and echo client to validate connectivity and TLS 1.3 handshake.

## Status
- QUIC Server (TLS 1.3, self-signed) using `quinn`, `rustls`, `rcgen`.
- QUIC Echo Client that trusts the locally generated server certificate and validates end-to-end connectivity.
- Structured Cargo workspace with clear separation of concerns.

## Repository Structure
- `apps/server/`: QUIC server application.
- `apps/client/`: QUIC echo client application.
- `crates/xeonvpn-core/`: common utilities, versioning, logging banner.
- `crates/xeonvpn-net/`: networking abstractions (future: TUN/TAP, routing, DNS, kill-switch).
- `crates/xeonvpn-quic/`: QUIC transport implementation (server-side POC, handlers, TLS config).
- `todo.md`: internal roadmap (kept out of VCS for now).

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Rust (stable) installed (https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- Supported OS: Windows and Linux. Current POC tested on Windows; Linux support is planned (TUN/DoH work upcoming).

### Build
```bash
cargo build
```

### Run the QUIC Server
This will generate a self-signed certificate and write `server_cert.der` at the repository root for local testing.
```bash
cargo run -p xeonvpn-server
```
Expected logs:
- "QUIC server listening on 0.0.0.0:4433"

### Run the Echo Client
The client reads `server_cert.der` generated by the server and connects to `127.0.0.1:4433`.
```bash
cargo run -p xeonvpn-client
```
Expected logs:
- "connected: 127.0.0.1:4433"
- "echoed back: hello from client"

If Windows Firewall prompts appear, allow UDP traffic for the server executable to avoid dropped packets.

## Roadmap
- The working roadmap lives in `todo.md` (currently git-ignored). Highlights:
  - Data plane: QUIC/WireGuard transport, congestion control, obfuscation.
  - Control plane: auth, configuration APIs, multi-region support (Asia-first).
  - Clients: Desktop and Mobile, DNS leak protection, split-tunnel, kill-switch.
  - Observability & security hardening.

## Development Notes
- Logging uses `tracing` with a sensible default so you can see INFO logs without setting `RUST_LOG`.
- QUIC is powered by `quinn` (with `rustls` TLS 1.3). The server uses `rcgen` to generate a self-signed certificate for local dev only.

## Security
This repository is in active development; do not use in production. Keys/certificates generated here are development-only and should never be deployed in real environments.

## License
TBD.

## Acknowledgements
- `quinn` for QUIC
- `rustls` for TLS 1.3
- `rcgen` for certificate generation
